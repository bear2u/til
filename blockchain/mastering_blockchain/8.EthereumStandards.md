From EIP-1:

```
EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

| [EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) | ERC-20 Token Standard. Describes standard functions a token contract may implement to allow Dapps and Wallets to handle tokens across multiple interfaces/DApps. Methods include:`totalSupply()`,`balanceOf(address)`,`transfer`,`transferFrom`,`approve`,`allowance`. Events include:`Transfer`\(triggered when tokens are transferred\),`Approval`\(triggered when`approve`is called\). | Fabian Vogelsteller, Vitalik Buterin | ERC | Final | Frontier |
| [EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md) | ERC-55 Mixed-case checksum address encoding | Vitalik Buterin | ERC | Final |  |
| [EIP-86](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/bd136e662fca4154787b44cded8d2a29b993be66/EIPS/abstraction.md) | Setting the stage for “abstracting out” account security, and allowing users creation of “account contracts” toward a model where in the long-term all accounts are contracts that can pay for gas, and users are free to defined their own security model \(that perform any desired signature verification and nonce checks instead of using the in-protocol mechanism where ECDSA and default nonce scheme are the only “standard” way to secure an account, which is currently hard-coded into transaction processing\). | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Deferred \(to be replaced\) | Constantinople |
| [EIP-96](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/210) | Setting the Blockhash and state root refactoring to store blockhashes in the state to reduce protocol complexity and need for client implementation complexity necessary to process the`BLOCKHASH`opcode. Extends range of how far back blockhash checking may go, with the side-effect of creating direct links between blocks with very distant block numbers to facilitate much more efficient initial Light Client syncing. | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Deferred | Constantinople |
| [EIP-100](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/100) | Change formula that computes the difficulty of a block \(difficulty adjustment algorithm\) to target mean block time and take uncles into account. | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-101](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-101.md) | Serenity Currency and Crypto Abstraction. Abstracting Ether up a level with the benefit of allowing Ether and sub-Tokens to be treated similarly by contracts, reducing level of indirection required for custom-policy accounts such as Multisigs, and purifying the underlying Ethereum protocol by reducing the minimal consensus implementation complexity | Vitalik Buterin | Active | Serenity feature | Serenity Casper |
| [EIP-105](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/03/05/serenity-poc2/) | “Sharding scaffolding” EIP to allow Ethereum transactions to be parallelised using a binary tree sharding mechanism, and to set the stage for a later sharding scheme. Research in progress:[_https://github.com/ethereum/sharding_](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding) | Vitalik Buterin | Active | Serenity feature | Serenity Casper |
| [EIP-137](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-137.md) | Ethereum Domain Name Service - Specification | Nick Johnson | ERC | Final |  |
| [EIP-140](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/206) | Add`REVERT`opcode instruction, which stops execution and rolls back the EVM execution state changes without consuming all provided gas \(instead the contract only has to pay for memory\) or losing logs, and returning to the caller a pointer to the memory location with the error code or message. | Alex Beregszaszi, Nikolai Mushegian | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-141](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-141.md) | Designated invalid EVM instruction | Alex Beregszaszi | Core | Final |  |

| [EIP-150](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md) | Gas cost changes for IO-heavy operations | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Final |  |
| [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) | Simple Replay Attack Protection. Replay Attack allows any transaction using a pre-EIP155 Ethereum Node or Client to become signed so it is valid and executed on both the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Final | Homestead |
| [EIP-158](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-158.md) | State clearing | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Superseded |  |
| [EIP-160](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-160.md) | EXP cost increase | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Final |  |

| [EIP-181](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-181.md) | ERC-181 ENS support for reverse resolution of Ethereum addresses | Nick Johnson | ERC | Final |  |
| [EIP-190](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-190.md) | ERC-190 Ethereum Smart Contract Packaging Standard | Merriam, Coulter, Erfurt, Catalano, Matias | ERC | Final |  |
| [EIP-196](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/213) | Precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication operations on the elliptic curve alt\_bn128, which are required in order to perform zkSNARK verification within the block gas limit | Christian Reitwiessner | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-197](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/212) | Precompiled contracts for optimal Ate pairing check of a pairing function on a specific pairing-friendly elliptic curve alt\_bn128 and is combined with EIP 196 | Vitalik Buterin, Christian Reitwiessner | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-198](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/198) | Precompile to support big integer modular exponentiation enabling RSA signature verification and other cryptographic applications | Vitalik Buterin | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-211](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/211) | New opcodes:`RETURNDATASIZE`and`RETURNDATACOPY`. Support for returning variable-length values inside the EVM with simple gas charging and minimal change to calling opcodes using new opcodes`RETURNDATASIZE`and`RETURNDATACOPY`. Handles similar to existing`calldata`, whereby after a call, return data is kept inside a virtual buffer from which the caller can copy it \(or parts thereof\) into memory, and upon the next call, the buffer is overwritten. | Christian Reitwiessner | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-214](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/214) | New opcode:`STATICCALL`. Permits non-state-changing calls to itself or other contracts whilst disallowing any modifications to state during the call \(and its sub-calls, if present\) to increase smart contract security and assure developers that re-entrancy bugs cannot arise from the call. Calls the child with`STATIC`flag set`true`for execution of child, causing exception to be thrown upon any attempts to make state-changing operations inside an execution instance where`STATIC`is set`true`, and resets flag once call returns. | Vitalik Buterin, Christian Reitwiessner | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-225](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/225) | Rinkeby Testnet using Proof-of-Authority where blocks only mined by trusted signers |  |  |  | Homestead |
| [EIP-234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-234.md) | Add`blockHash`to JSON-RPC filter options | Micah Zoltu | Interface | Draft |  |

| [EIP-681](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-681.md) | ERC-681 URL Format for Transaction Requests | Daniel A. Nagy | Interface | Draft |  |
| [EIP-649](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/669) | Metropolis Difficulty Bomb Delay and Block Reward Reduction - Delay of the Ice Age \(aka the Difficulty Bomb by 1 year\), and reduction of the block reward from 5 to 3 ether. | Afri Schoedon, Vitalik Buterin | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-658](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/658) | Embedding transaction status code in receipts. Fetch and embed status field indicative of success or failure state to transaction receipts for callers, as was no longer able to assume the transaction failed if and only if \(iff\) it consumed all gas after the introduction of the`REVERT`opcode in EIP-140. | Nick Johnson | Core | Final | Metropolis Byzantinium |
| [EIP-706](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-706.md) | DEVp2p snappy compression | Péter Szilágyi | Networking | Final |  |
| [EIP-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721) | ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token \(NFT\) Standard. It is a standard API that would allow smart contracts to operate as unique tradable non-fungible tokens \(NFT\) that may be tracked in standardised wallets and traded on exchanges as assets of value, similar to ERC-20. CryptoKitties was the first popularly-adopted implementation of a digital NFT in the Ethereum ecosystem. | William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, Nastassia Sachs | Standard | Draft |  |
| [EIP-758](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-758.md) | Subscriptions and filters for transaction return data | Jack Peterson | Interface | Draft |  |
| [EIP-801](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-801.md) | ERC-801 Canary Standard | ligi | Interface | Draft |  |
| [EIP-827](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/827) | ERC-827 A extension of the standard interface ERC20 for tokens with methods that allows the execution of calls inside transfer and approvals. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party. Also it allows to execute calls on transfers and approvals. | Augusto Lemble | ERC | Draft |  |
|  |  |  |  | [EIP-930](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/930) | ERC-930 The ES \(Eternal Storage\) contract is owned by an address that have write permissions. The storage is public, which means everyone has read permissions. It store the data on mappings, using one mapping per type of variable. The use of this contract allows the developer to migrate the storage easily to another contract if needed. |
